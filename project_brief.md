# Final CodeClan Project

## Advert placing System:
Your organisation has been asked to create an advert placing system for a small ads company. The company wants to allow customers to place online adverts on their site. 

The first phase of development will allow a single customer to place, view and update their own adverts. You will develop this part of the system.


### MVP:
The subsystem must be able to:

- Allow a customer to place an advert on the site.
- Adverts will belong to a particular category. Allowable categories are: Books, Clothes, Hardware, Cars, Electronics + a few more?
- An advert will display category, description, price and customer contact details.
- Allow customers to view all of their own adverts.
- Allow customers to view their adverts by category.
- Allow the customer to update or delete their advert.

* It is assumed that the customer has been authenicated and is logged into their own account.


### MVP++:
- Calculate cost to place advert (based on value of item + category).
- Allow users to search for adverts using keywords.
- Allow users to search for adverts that have been placed within a specific time period.
- Add image for item.


### Project Extensions:

- Create a login page for customers - without authentication at this point (i.e., no password required).
- Allow customers to view ALL adverts - including those placed by other customers.
- Accept payment from customer.
- Calculate how much customer has spent on placing adverts.

- Whatever features might be beneficial to an ads company.
